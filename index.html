                Technology has been one of the most undeniably biggest influencing fields in human history.
                Along with the rapid development of the technology revolution,
                3D printing technology has opened a new chapter of innovation
                when creating three-dimensional products from digital designs. This technology is considered to have a
                lot of potential to become a leading industry. Today, we, CSZ, are going to help you better understand
                this potential technology!!<br><br> 3D printing technology is completely different from the definitions we have heard before,
                like 3D painting, or 3D film. It's the same as a normal printer, but then it's a little different.<br><br>Firstly, you don't place the cartridge yet,
                but instead connect the spool with a special printing material such as filament, rubber, or even metal.
                And you're not printing boring text documents but realistic models of what you've just created on your computer screen.<br><br>Most of the 3D models
