            <h2>[3D PRINTING TECHNOLOGY]</h2>
            <p>
                Technology has been one of the most undeniably biggest influencing fields in human history.
                Along with the rapid development of the technology revolution,
                3D printing technology has opened a new chapter of innovation
                when creating three-dimensional products from digital designs. This technology is considered to have a
                lot of potential to become a leading industry. Today, we, CSZ, are going to help you better understand
                this potential technology!!<br><br> 3D printing technology is completely different from the definitions we have heard before,
                like 3D painting, or 3D film. It's the same as a normal printer, but then it's a little different.<br><br>Firstly, you don't place the cartridge yet,
                but instead connect the spool with a special printing material such as filament, rubber, or even metal.
                And you're not printing boring text documents but realistic models of what you've just created on your computer screen.<br><br>Most of the 3D models
                have to be designed on well - known 3D drawing software such as SketchUp or AutoCAD or they can be downloaded from available websites. The design will
                be transferred to a 3D printer for printing. At this stage, the printer will divide the 3D model into several layers and print them one by one until
                the final product is complete. Besides, depending on the printing material, the machine will produce the corresponding product. Luckily, VNUK Maker Space
                is equipped with a 3D printer (FDM) along with many types of plastic filaments of different colors, so you can freely express your creativity.<br><br>It
                may sound academic, but in a nutshell, imagine slicing a lemon into thin slices, and after that, when stacking the slices together in order, you will get
                the shape of a lemon again. 3D printers also work according to that principle, the machine will calculate the 3D model layers and then start printing layer
                by layer from bottom to top until a complete printed pattern is produced.<br><br>That sounds interesting, right? So do you want to create your own 3D products?
                In the near future CSZ will support you in the Design Thinking course to complete your 3D demo products. A little hint that this is just the first step on the
                journey, later on, each VNUK student will have the opportunity to make their own 3D items at Maker Space.<br><br>Technology has been one of the most undeniably biggest influencing fields in human history.
